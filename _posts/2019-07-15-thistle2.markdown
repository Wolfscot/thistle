Thistle is the common name of a group of flowering plants characterised by leaves with sharp prickles on the margins, mostly in the family Asteraceae. Prickles can also occur all over the plant – on the stem and on the flat parts of the leaves. These prickles are an adaptation that protects the plant from being eaten by herbivores. Typically, an involucre with a clasping shape similar to a cup or urn subtends each of a thistle's flowerheads.
Genera in the Asteraceae with the word thistle often used in their common names include:

Carduus – musk thistle and others
Carlina – carline thistle
Carthamus – distaff thistle
Centaurea – star thistle
Cicerbita – sow thistle
Cirsium – common thistle, field thistle and others
Cnicus – blessed thistle
Cynara – artichoke, cardoon
Echinops – globe thistle
Notobasis – Syrian thistle
Onopordum – cotton thistle, also known as Scots or Scotch thistle
Scolymus – golden thistle or oyster thistle
Silybum – milk thistle
Sonchus – sow thistle
Plants in families other than Asteraceae which are sometimes called thistle include:

Kali – Russian thistle, Tartar thistle, or tumbleweed, plants formerly classified in the genus Salsola (family Chenopodiaceae)
Argemone mexicana – flowering thistle, Mexican prickly poppy
